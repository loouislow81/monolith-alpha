# Working Offline

Codebox lets you sync your files offline to keep working when your network is down (or when you're in the plane).

### Downloading files for offline uses

When you open the IDE, it will automatically start downloading all your project in your local machine, this operation can take a few seconds or minutes according to the size of your project. This operation will also be run periodically to keep the local verison updated.

You can also manually run the download operation using the "Synchronize" menu.
