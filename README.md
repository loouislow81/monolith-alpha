## Why is CodeBox great?

* Easy to run
* Fully web IDE
* Collaborative: Boxes are natively collaborative (code editor, terminals, ...)
* Extensible: Codebox is build on top of a very modular architecture

## How to use it?

First of all install codebox on your machine using npm:

```
$ npm install -g codebox
```

You can now run Codebox into a directory (Codebox can only be run on GIT repository):

```
